ttestBatteryLife

A manufacturer claims that the average lifetime of its batteries is 500 hours, with a known standard deviation of 100 hours. A quality control team tests 30 randomly selected batteries, obtaining the following lifetimes

495, 520, 510, 505, 480, 500, 515, 495, 510, 505, 490, 515, 495, 505, 500, 510, 485, 495, 500, 520, 510, 495, 505, 500, 515, 505, 495, 510, 500, 495

Perform a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level to determine whether the mean battery lifetime differs significantly from 500 hours. Also, compute the p-value and plot the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve for a range of true means.
